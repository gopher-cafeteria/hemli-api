# Gin Example

This example starts an [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) server.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frailwayapp%2Fexamples%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fexamples%2Fgin)

## ✨ How to run

1. Install dependencies

```
$ go get -d ./...
```

2. navigate to the cmd directory

```
$ cd .\cmd\
```

3. run the application

```
$ go run .
```

## 💁‍♀️ How to use

- Connect to your Railway project `railway link`
- Start the development server `railway run go run main.go`

## 📝 Notes

The server started simply returns a `message: Hello world! ` payload in JSON. The server code is located in the `main.go` file.
